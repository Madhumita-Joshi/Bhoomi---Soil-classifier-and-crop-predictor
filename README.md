# Bhoomi---Soil-classifier-and-crop-predictor
Soil can be categorised into different types based on certain externally recognizable features such as Ph value,colour texture etc.Machine Learning and image processing are two emerging technologies that can be used for analysing these features and grouping the soils. A machine learning model will be trained with features extracted from multiple soil images. A fully trained classifier will then be able to classify the soil image provided by the end user. This project broadly consists of 4 phases: Image processing, Feature extraction, Classifier Modelling, crop prediction and Frontend development.
